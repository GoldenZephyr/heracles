# Development Notes

## Converting between `spark_dsg` and Neo4J schema

Currently there is a manual step of turning each `spark_dsg` node into a dictionary of its attributes, which is then used to fill in the graph database schema. It would be slightly cleaner if this dict was automatically generated by calling `vars()` or `__dict__` on the `spark_dsg` node, but those objects are lacking a `__dict__`, I assume because of pybind11-related reasons. I don't really want to deal with adding that functionality to our pybind11 `spark_dsg` interface, so for now we have this intermediate dictionary "representation"
